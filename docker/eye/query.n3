# This document is a query that instructs the EYE reasoner
# what triples it should try to derive,
# and what triples it should output.

# The query below instructs the reasoner to derive all triples,
# and to return all of them unchanged.
# While this is an easy query to start with,
# its output can be overwhelming
# and sometimes infinite (because reasoning is recursive).
